        <h4>Weekly Responses</h4>
        <p>
          A brief response (5 to 10 lines) about the assigned book will be due by 7 AM the morning of the next class each
week. Responses are to be submitted by email to pdaiello@lifespan.org – the administrative assistant. She will
print out the assignments for Dr. Flanigan and Dr. Wing and a few of your responses will be read anonymously to the
class each week. <b>(If your response is personal in nature and you would prefer we not read it out load, please write
that at the top of the response.)</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Class Discussion/Jeopardy</h4>
        <p>
          Each week 2-3 students will lead the class in discussion. They will prepare a handout <b>(1-page front and back)</b> with
pertinent questions to aid in organizing discussion. (Feel free to put quotes in to guide the discussion). A second
group of students will prepare a round of Jeopardy based on the assigned book. Sign-ups will occur during the first
week of class, <b>with the aid of a

  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XaXL--bwzRJkSjz-cAHqDb4FktqWDXJ2rh5mVLl_98o/edit?usp=sharing">goggle sheet</a>

  .</b> If a student signed up and participates in Jeopardy or Discussion
group, they are not required to do a written assignment that week. <b>It is required that each student lead at least 1
Jeopardy and 1 Discussion per session.</b>
        </p>

        <br/>
        <h4>Papers / Essays Assigned</h4>
        <p>
          There will be a Midterm (7 to 10 pages) and a Final Paper (5 to 7 pages) due for the course. The midterm topic will

          be based on the Narnia series, The Great Divorce, or any aspect of the Space Trilogy. (If you want to do this on

          something specific, you can talk to Dr. Flanigan beforehand.) The final paper will be on a topic of your choice that

          has some relationship to the writings or life of C. S. Lewis. This includes writing about the Inklings, any of C. S. Lewis’

          mentors, the relevance of C. S. Lewis to Brown or any aspect of modern life, or an approved interactive project. One

          novel that students have recommended highly is A Severe Mercy, by Sheldon Van Auken, a close friend and

          contemporary of C. S. Lewis.

          <b>Please make sure you send your assignments to Pat D’Aiello at pdaiello@lifespan.org. The assignment should be

embedded in the email (not a separate attachment) and the Subject Line should have the Name of the Book you

are reviewing and the Day of your class, (i.e. RE: The Silver Chair - Wednesday.)</b><br/>

The Drs. Flanigan and Wing don’t always have time to check their emails so I do this for them and print out the

assignments weekly. These should be sent as early as possible so that the Doctors have time to go over them

before class.
